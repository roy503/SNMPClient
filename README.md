Printer SNMP Client

Get printer info from list of networked printer IP addresses.

TODO:

Currently set to SNMP V1, need to use latest version and find a way to use earlier version if later is not available. i.e. Attempt to use latest version, if unable, use previous version. e.g. Try to use 3 failed, use 2c failed, use 1.

Add more comments.

Print an XML file of printer stats. create css to display the XML file.

Potentially use different input method, currently using txt file with each ip address on new line. Is it possible to search AD for all printers in certain subnet?
